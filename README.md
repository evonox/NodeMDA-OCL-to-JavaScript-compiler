# OCL Compiler to Javascript for NodeMDA

This project has been currently created and is still under construction.

## Introduction
This project is a Node package that implements **OCL Compiler** generating code into JavaScript. **OCL** acronym 
stands for **Object Constraint Language** which is a pure query language to impose constraints on UML model
elements. The purpose of this package is to generate code into JavasScript to ensure that the constraints, which were modeled in a UML diagram, are fulfilled at runtime.

This package is not meant for a stand-alone use because it is tightly binded to the 
[**NodeMDA**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemda) code-generation engine developed by Joel Kozikowski.
